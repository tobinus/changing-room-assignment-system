# ChangingRoomAssignmentSystem

System for figuring out which team should be given which changing room
at the indoor arena EIKA Fet Arena.

This repository contains documentation for the project, and the software known as the
"Match Schedule preparation", which includes the "Schedule fetcher" and
"Changing Room Assignment System". This system is responsible for fetching the match
schedule, adding information about which changing room each team should use, and
making this information available for the digital signage system ([simpleInfoscreen](https://github.com/tobinus/simpleInfoscreen)).

See `doc/Analysis of Changing Room Assignment Problem for EIKA Fet Arena.pdf`
for more information about the system's background, purpose and architecture.
